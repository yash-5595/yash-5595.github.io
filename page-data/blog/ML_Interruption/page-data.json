This work outlines a semi-supervised strategy to automatically detect traffic interruptions occurring on arteries using high resolution data from widely deployed inductive loop detectors. The techniques highlighted in this paper are tested on data collected from detectors installed on more than 300 signalized intersections over a 6 month period. Our results show that we can detect interruptions with high precision and recall.","Published":"2020 Fifth International Conference on Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC)"},"excerpt":"Our goal in this paper is to use large scale loop detector data for detecting traffic interruptions.
