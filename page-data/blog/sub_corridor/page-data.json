Such coordination of intersections can result in improvements in the quality of traffic flow along an arterial or street. The current practice for coordinating and re-timing intersections remains a largely manual process and is based on temporally limited data samples.

Current systems that focus on automatically converting the raw data into measures of effectiveness have proven extremely useful in alleviating intersection performance issues. However, these systems are not well suited for automatically generating recommendations or suggesting fixes as needed. In this work, we demonstrate the use of machine learning and data compression techniques to build a recommendation system. Specifically, we present an end to end solution for automatically generating intersection coordination plans.","Published":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)"},"excerpt":"Coordination involves synchronizing multiple intersections to enhance the operation of directional movements in a system.\nTypically, theâ€¦","timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/sub_corridor/","templatePath":"./src/templates/blog-post.js"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3144751780","796719167"]}
