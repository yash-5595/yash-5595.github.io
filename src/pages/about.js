          Iâ€™m currently working on research projects funded by the Florida Department of Transportation, National Science 
          Foundation to develop novel machine learning techniques for improving the efficiency of urban road transportation networks. 
          I've been working on developing a machine learning based system that fuses information from multiple sensors 
          to develop real-time algorithms for - signal retiming for intersections and corridors to reflect the changes in 
          network demand patterns, incident detection for for alleviating traffic backups and secondary crashes.

          Also, I've been working on a National Institute of Aging funded research to develop secure wearable technology 
          infrastructure for sensor based real-time mobility monitoring, to capture health events in older adults. 
          The goal is to harness sensor, interface capabilities in smart watches to provide a platform for monitoring health 
          interventions. The collected data is used for research on behaviors, health and mobility patterns of the individuals
