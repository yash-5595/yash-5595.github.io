- Developed machine learning algorithms focused on modelling spatio-temporal dynamics in traffic flow. Different use cases for these predictive/descriptive models include detecting unusual time periods, summarizing mobility patterns, modelling contextual changes etc </p>

* Developed an Encoder-Decoder with attention to model traffic outflow waveforms at a sub cycle level. This model improved the accuracy by 40% over existing baseline methods and is used as base for arterial flow prediction and signal timing optimization </p>

* Developed a system detect traffic interruptions (anamoly) in real time using ground sensor data. Applied PCA on time series and a combination of feed forward network to achieve an accuracy of 90\% outperforming several other existing methods. </p>

* Developed a module for SUMO (open source microscopic traffic simulator) to create synthetic traffic flow datasets. This module supports running several thousand simulations in parallel and generating datasets with desired flow distributions. </p>

* Currently working on developing general purpose pre-trained NN's to model traffic flow in a network using simulated datasets. These pretrained models will be used to evaluate the efficiency of multiple candidate signal timing plans, using  Monte Carlo tree search to find best signal timing plans for the network  </p>


* These models are developed at scale by fusing different data sources from 300 intersections in City of Orlando. Also, this work led to 5 peer reviewed publications in high impact conferences.</p>
